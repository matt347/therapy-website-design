Eliza's personal therapy website!

To learn about the specialties Eliza offers, to learn prices and how to contact, follow this link!
You can get to know Eliza through her work and her homepage. You can reach out to ask questions
through a form or browse the pricing options and understand who Eliza is on this website.

Some features we have include a form sent to Eliza, many many details about what she does, good
stylistic choices to make the user feel at home, simplicity through layout to not overwhelm the
user, and more!

In order to make changes to the website, download the repository!
1. Text changing: Find the appropriate file that holds the text you want to change with control + F
   then from there you want to edit the text to your liking
2. Image changing: Look through the images that are used on the website by finding the "images" folder
   and then locating the image you want to change with control + F
3. Layout ordering changes: If you want to move a section of the website below another section, simply
   grab the entire block starting and ending with "section" then move this section to the desired area,
   and put it after any other "section" blocks you see if changing block is not going to become the
   first block, otherwise before any other "section" blocks you see.
4. See the changes you made on your website: to PUSH changes, you must use git commands or GitHub Desktop
   (much simpler) so that you can PUSH changes by either clicking the bottom on GitHub Desktop or typing
   in the series of commands needed by terminal. After a few minutes, the changes will show up on your
   website, so do not worry if you do not see them right away!
