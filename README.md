# therapy-website-design
Custom website designed for our client's needs as a therapist.

Specialties, services, and prices will be listed. Client can work through a 
self assessment quiz or book an appointment online by submitting a few personal details.

In order to run this page, download the repo, and open the directory link in your browser.



Deployed on the github, as well as on vercel (where we will be developing backend parts) at:
https://therapy-website-design-mtdeweeses-projects.vercel.app/




Class branch now also contains a inquire page, which allows us to have a form handling page that sends data to mongodb, as well as a call to a free llm api that lets us "check if the potential client is compatible"
