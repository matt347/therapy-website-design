        <img src="images/profile.png" alt="Picture of Eliza Sparkes" />
        <p>I’m Eliza Sparkes, and I’m a licensed independent clinical social worker. I use she/her pronouns, identify as
        white, mixed European background, queer and cis-gendered. I have worked as a therapist for the last 8+ years, and
        have experience providing psychotherapy in community health settings with individuals, families, and in group
        settings. I’ve worked with individuals across the age and identity spectrum including (and not limited to)
        immigrants, Spanish-speakers, LGBQIA+, trans and gender-expansive folks, and young adults. I use a
        trauma-informed, client-centered, relational approach and have been trained in Narrative therapy, EMDR, and parts
        work.</p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 30px">What its like to work with me</h3>
        <p>I believe that most people come to therapy looking to change something that isn’t working in their life, to
        process past and current negative experiences, gain deeper self knowledge and insight, and above all, to alleviate
        suffering and to heal.To that end, I believe that the client is the expert of their own life. My role is to offer
        curiosity, compassion, accountability, humor, education about the impacts of trauma and other mental health
        challenges, and to provide a trusting, nonjudgmental space. I use an anti-oppressive lens, which means I’m always
        considering (and encouraging my clients to consider) the impacts that racism, sexism, capitalism, homophobia, and
        white supremacy culture have had on their life. I see the therapeutic relationship as a space that might offer
        reparative experiences, and a “laboratory” of self-discovery and behavior change.</p>
