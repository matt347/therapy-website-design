          Currently, I accept Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Masshealth (Wellsense/Carelon only), and Optum. This list is
          ever-changing, please inquire to see whether I may be in the process of accepting your insurance!

          If you plan to pay out of pocket, my rate for a 50-minute session is $175. I offer a sliding scale for those
          who may have difficulty paying my full rate. I encourage you to use the “Green Bottle” image to help you
          decide where you might fall on the scale. I can offer a “superbill” for those who may have Out of Network
          benefits coverage.

          I am generally available during some weekly evening hours, and have limited daytime availability. At the
          moment, my services are telehealth only.
